# Core Development Principles

1. NEVER take shortcuts or create minimal versions - Always implement the most optimal, production-ready, industry-standard solutions
2. ALWAYS use British English spelling and terminology throughout all code, documentation, and user-facing content
3. NEVER add attribution to Claude or similar AI tools in code comments, commit messages, or documentation
4. REMEMBER the complete tech stack even if parts aren't implemented yet - we follow a proper roadmap and architecture
5. ALWAYS commit logical changes at important steps with industry-standard commit messages following conventional commit format
6. ALWAYS implement comprehensive, production-ready solutions that meet enterprise standards for security, performance, and maintainability

# File Management Rules

7. Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
8. NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal
9. ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one
10. NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User
